amortization
============

This is a simple CLI application for creating amortization tables. The current goals of this application are:

- log transactions, both regular payments and principal payments
- generate correct amortization table based on transactions
- create a GUI

Once the above is implemented, I'll decide whether to try to integrate this with GNUCash or compete directly by implementing accounting features.
